# Supreme Group Clone

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

A responsive and performance-optimized clone of the Supreme Group website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## üß± Component Architecture Overview

- **App Structure:**  
  The project follows a modular component-based architecture. Core UI elements are separated into reusable components (e.g., Header, Footer, etc).
- **Pages:**  
  Each route is defined in the `app/` directory, leveraging Next.js file-based routing.
- **State Management:**  
  Local component state is used for UI interactions. For shared state, React Context API is integrated as needed.

## üñ•Ô∏è Responsive Design Strategy

This project employs a **mobile-first responsive design** approach using [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/). Tailwind‚Äôs utility-first classes were leveraged to ensure consistent styling and adaptability across various screen sizes. Breakpoints such as `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` were used to tailor layouts, typography, spacing, and alignment for optimal viewing on devices ranging from smartphones to large desktops.

### Key Responsive Design Practices:

- **Mobile-first layout** with progressive enhancement for larger screens.
- **Flexible grid and flexbox utilities** to manage alignment and spacing dynamically.
- **Conditional styling** using Tailwind‚Äôs responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `lg:`, etc.).
- **Scalable icons and images** with adaptive sizing.

This approach ensures that the user experience remains seamless and visually appealing across all devices.

## üöÄ Performance Optimization Techniques Employed

To ensure fast load times and efficient resource usage, the project incorporates several performance optimization strategies:

- **Framer Motion for Animations**:  
  Integrated [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for smooth, performant animations. Used it to animate content transitions, entrance effects, and UI interactions with fine-grained control, improving the user experience without sacrificing performance.

- **Next.js `<Image>` Component**:  
  Utilized for all image rendering to benefit from automatic lazy loading, optimized image delivery, and responsive sizing, significantly improving page performance and reducing Largest Contentful Paint (LCP).

- **Reusable Component Structure**:  
  The codebase is structured around reusable and modular components, which minimizes redundancy, improves maintainability, and reduces the size of client-side JavaScript.

- **Font Optimization**:  
  Uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for efficient font loading and automatic subsetting, which reduces unused font data and improves rendering speed.

## ‚ôø Accessibility Considerations

This project follows best practices to ensure that the application is accessible and usable by all users, including those relying on assistive technologies. Key accessibility considerations include:

- **Semantic HTML**: Used appropriate HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.) to convey meaning and structure, aiding screen readers and improving keyboard navigation.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Interactive elements like buttons and links are focusable and usable via keyboard, enhancing navigation for users who cannot use a mouse.
- **Alt Text for Images**: All images include descriptive `alt` attributes, ensuring content is accessible to screen readers.
- **Color Contrast**: Ensured sufficient contrast between text and background to meet WCAG AA standards for readability.

These practices help create an inclusive user experience that accommodates users with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments.

## üß† Assumptions & Decisions

- The UI/UX is modeled after the Supreme Group website, prioritizing clarity and simplicity.
- Chose Next.js for its SSR/SSG capabilities and developer experience.
- Used Tailwind CSS for rapid prototyping and responsive design.
- Assumed a modern browser environment.

## üß© Challenges Faced & Potential Solutions

- **Challenge:** Achieving pixel-perfect design fidelity.  
  **Solution:** Iterative refinement using design tools (e.g., Figma) alongside browser developer tools. Leveraged Tailwind's utility classes to closely align components with the design specs.

- **Challenge:** Optimizing performance for large images.  
  **Solution:** Utilized the `<Image>` component from Next.js to enable automatic image optimization, lazy loading, and responsive sizing.

- **Challenge:** Managing dynamic content and component reusability.  
  **Solution:** Created modular, reusable React components to avoid repetition and improve maintainability. Used context for state sharing across components.

- **Challenge:** Maintaining responsiveness across devices.  
  **Solution:** Applied a mobile-first design strategy using Tailwind CSS breakpoints to fine-tune layouts and typography for various screen sizes.

- **Challenge:** Ensuring accessible and inclusive UI.  
  **Solution:** Followed semantic HTML standards, implemented proper `alt` text, maintained focus outlines, and considered contrast ratios for readability.

- **Challenge:** Handling video playback interactions dynamically.  
  **Solution:** Used React `ref` and controlled state to toggle play/pause, reset on video changes, and animate transitions conditionally for a better UX.
